Who am I? That's a great question. I am still trying to figure that out. But my name is Taisuke Mino and most people call me Tai. I am a Japanese programmer who has been obsessed with the blockchain since 2013. My mission is to build a healthy financial system for all. While I was in [South Park Commons](https://www.southparkcommons.com/), I started to build a DeFi protocol called [Carapace](http://carapace.finance). We aim to be the biggest credit risk management tool in DeFi.

I am interested in many things and consider myself a generalist. Iâ€™m not the best programmer in the world, but I can design a crypto protocol, write articles, sell a product, raise funds, hire talent, and design UX. I am not the best in the world in any of them but I am fairly good at all of them.

I adore reading books, watching documentaries, playing strategic games, doing calisthenics, and cooking/exploring vegan food.

Writing is such a crucial part of my life. I write to think everyday. I publish some of them in this blog and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/tai/).
