Here are some useful command-line tools that I use frequently to increase my productivity.

- [**tldr**](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) is a more concise version of a man page.

- [**bat**](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) is a cat command with highlighting, paging, line numbers, and git integration.

- [**htop**](https://hisham.hm/htop/) is a top command that acts as an activity monitor in your Terminal but with highlighting, keyboard bindings and different views.

- [**t**](https://github.com/sferik/t%0A) is a twitter client in your Terminal. 

- [**z**](https://github.com/rupa/z) is a cd command that jumps to a directory by tracking your most used directories.
